<font size="1"> Project overview: </font> <br /> 
'Hostel Chai?' is an online platform that will help students to find the hostels in different locations. In this platform, we are connecting the students with the hostel owners or managers. Hostel owners will post the full description of the hostel, for example, room description, facilities, cost, meal, environment, address, contact information, etc. Here students can also give rating and review about the hostels in different criteria and these ratings will help other students to find out the perfect hostel for him or her. Moreover, we are ensuring user authentication. <br />
<br />

<font size="1"> Motivation of 'Hostel Chai?'</font> <br /> 
According to UGC (University Grants Commission, Bangladesh) Report, there are 107 private universities in Bangladesh, there are more than 50 private universities and approximately 150 colleges in Dhaka city and most of these universities and colleges are not providing the resident facilities to their students. So, it’s a tough job for students to find the perfect hostel for him or her when he or she comes outside from Dhaka. That’s why we are trying to give them a platform from where they can find the perfect hostel for them easily. It’s true that, there are some websites and Facebook groups available for this house rent purpose. But these platforms are not dedicated for students’ welfare and this is why we have come forward to make this happen.
